    "### Passing DRS ids to the right DRS server\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers two related topics about DRS\n",
    "* Sending DRS requests to the right server \n",
    "* Two different kinds of DRS URI\n",
    "\n",
    "The fasp-clients package installed for this tutorial contains a class to handle both these aspects of DRS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any regular DRS server only responds to the local ids known to it. Notebook 2-1 explored that basic DRS capability. We saw that the NCBI DRS server could return information about the following DRS id.\n",
    "* fb1cfb04d3ef99d07c21f9dbf87ccc68\n",
    "\n",
    "In another case, the BioDataCatalyst DRS server knows about and can resolve the following local id\n",
    "* e747c529-a6ee-415f-90b8-e2db631f8ed9\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these local ids globally unique and usable they need to be expressed as DRS URIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compact DRS URIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Compact URIs use a short prefix which is associated with a specific DRS server. For example, the prefix dg.4503 was registered for BioDataCatalyst. This allows the id to be referred to globally as \n",
    "* dg.4503:e747c529-a6ee-415f-90b8-e2db631f8ed9\n",
    "\n",
    "The form of DRS id above is known as a compact DRS URI.\n",

    "* dbgap:phs000200.v11.p3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Host based DRS URIs - the second form of DRS URIs\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all data providers use compact identifiers by registering a prefix as shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is a host based DRS URI . For example, the globally unique URI for the NCBI DRS is above is:\n",
    "* drs://locate.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/fb1cfb04d3ef99d07c21f9dbf87ccc68\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the URI is not a URL that can be used in a script or a browser to get a response. We still need to use a tool that knows how to work with the drs protocol or \"scheme\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One benefit of compact ids is that if NCBI were to change the location of its host from be-md (Bethesda, Maryland) the compact ids would remain valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A metaresolver for DRS\n",
    "We need a tool that knows about different DRS servers and how to pass our request to the right one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DRSMetaResolver in fasp-clients will:\n",
    "* Resolve compact ids\n",
    "* Resolve host based DRS ids\n",
    "* Send DRS calls to the correct server\n",
    "* Handle id's prefixed with drs:// or not\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "The DRSMetaresolver appears like a DRS Client. It supports the two basic DRS functions\n",
    "* get_object\n",
    "* get_access_url\n",
    "\n",
    " üñê Run the following examples and review how each kind of DRS id is handled\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: As in previous examples create a client\n",
    "This time our client is a metaresolver"
