# Session 1: Introduction to GA4GH, Federated Analysis, and the Starter Kit

**Time:** Sunday, July 10th, 2022 @ 11 am - 12 pm

In this session, we will give an overview of the GA4GH, highlighting its role as a technical standards-setting organization in the genomics space. We will also outline some of the technical standards that audience members will most likely be familiar with (BAM, CRAM, VCF).

Next, we will outline the key GA4GH standards pertaining to federated analysis that will be covered during the tutorial: Data Repository Service (DRS), Workflow Execution Service (WES), Passports, and Data Connect. We'll look at the roles and responsibilities of each standard API, and how they fit together to enable federated analysis.
