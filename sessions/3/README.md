# Session 3: Federated Analysis - Run workflows using the Workflow Execution Service (WES)

## Outline

This session would likely be #5 in the running order

Still need to work out the balance between this session and the previous one. Though previous session is focussed on Data Connect and DRS, may be good to take it all the way through to a workflow example. This session would then look at more advanced examples (as advanced as appropriate - need to find the right level ).

A controlled access example should feature, possibly in this session, possibly in previous. 

**Time:** Sunday, July 10th, 2022 @ 2 pm - 3:15 pm

**Slides:** [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16AozizVh3pQ_RMuz4kLECt-MfjraKVH-BvcjMOpqCtU)

In this session, participants will learn how to run workflows on the data accessed in the previous session. Workflows will be run at the same location as the data and the results aggregated from different locations.

## Tutorial

Possibly CNest compute on TopMed etc. doesn't feature intil this session.

### Session specific requirements

Access permission and credentials (API key, credentials file, passport or whatever the host service accepts).
