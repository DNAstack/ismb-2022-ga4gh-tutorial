# Session 2: Federated Analysis - Find and access data in the cloud via Data Connect and Data Repository Service (DRS)

## Outline

**Time:** Sunday, July 10th, 2022 @ 12 pm - 1 pm

**Slides:** [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zuw_KVO_TQy91ODBWYmObkc_FTkAK7iy-SETjTY5TkQ)

<!--Suggestion that this session would be #4 in the running order.-->

The key addition from previous sessions is to run scripts and notebooks against GA4GH services provided by GA4GH Driver Projects and other data providers.

Participants will use python clients for GA4GH services and write scripts in Jupyter notebooks.

Participants will interact with Driver Project implementations of Data Connect and DRS to locate and access files in datasets such as TCGA, GTEx, and TopMed and run workflows against them using WES (though that could be the add in the following session).

## Tutorial

Candidate scripts to be selected from https://github.com/ga4gh/fasp-scripts/tree/master/notebooks

For follow on from morning sessions will likely use CNest example.

## Session specific requirements

Jupyter

Fasp-scripts

Starter accounts with cloud credits on selected platforms (to be listed e.g. Seven Bridges BioData Catalyst)
