# Session 2: Federated Analysis - Find and access data in the cloud via Data Connect and Data Repository Service (DRS)

## Outline

**Time:** Sunday, July 10th, 2022 @ 12 pm - 1 pm

**Slides:** [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zuw_KVO_TQy91ODBWYmObkc_FTkAK7iy-SETjTY5TkQ)

Participants will use python clients for GA4GH services and write scripts in Jupyter notebooks.

Participants will interact with Driver Project implementations of Data Connect and DRS to locate and access files in datasets such as TCGA, GTEx, and TopMed and run workflows against them using WES (though that could be the add in the following session).
